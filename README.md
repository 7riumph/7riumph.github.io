## Description
An interactive [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) slideshow presentation. It details the American bison's history and significance.  

## Purpose 
Through this capstone project, I learned about the American bisonâ€™s historical and modern significance. Especially as that significance relates with how plains First Nations (Akainai, Piikani, Amskapi Pikuni, Apache, and more) worldviews, cultures, values, and Medicine Wheel teachings, help to paint a picture of why land and resource sustainability is intrinsic to the Aboriginal voice.

## Project Sections
