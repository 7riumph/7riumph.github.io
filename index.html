The “Canadian Encyclopedia” website says “with all 30 million lined up, they would have gone around the equator about 1.3 times.” This unencumbered abundance was a direct result of inherent plains Aboriginal sustainability principles (Siksika, Cree, Apache, and more). Harmony, and not commodity, defined this worldview’s interconnection with all of creation or the natural world. Chief Seattle (1786–1866) says it best, “Humans merely share the earth, we can only protect the land not own it.” and that “The earth does not belong to us. We belong to the earth.”</p>"

This had a snowball effect; as more settlers sought to profit off the bison, more bison were hunted and killed unsustainably. European worldviews are individualist. Ownership of land and resources is a motivator because the end goal is self-promotion and dominion as opposed to Aboriginal worldviews that centre around communal promotion and harmony with the land. Bison populations shrank by as much as 2 million per year. Through sectioned off land via European settlement and projects like the “Intercolonial Railway”, there were fewer and fewer places bison could thrive.</p>"

In “Yellowstone National Park” (Wyoming) there are about 5000 bison and 500 in “Theodore Roosevelt National Park.” Bison also find themselves in ranches as livestock. There are as many as 400,000 bison in ranches. Wild bison are rare. Beyond ranches and national parks, there have also been specific efforts to harmonize with the bison on a ”human to nature level” through the lens of modern times. The Aboriginal-owned “Tsuut'ina Buffalo Paddocks”, which is local to me, is one example. Its herd of 300 bison is not commercialized, it exists solely as a link to the past and is maintained as a way to honour the ancestors and take hold of their roots in the modern era.</p>"
