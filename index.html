The modern era brings hope for the bison yellow stone national park is in wyoming also my calgary local tsuut'ina buffalo paddocks with 300 bison is a great example. Take Prairie Preserve in northeastern Oklahoma for example where the bison are being used to restore the praries. As all nature harmonies the bison and their graising is an inheratn part in what allows theis ecosystem to florish, they are codependant. its nice to see this codependance respected in moderns. a long way to go on the road to restoration as evident by the graph on next slide. in resroting these populations to some of their former glory</p>"
